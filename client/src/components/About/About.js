                I'm an experienced web developer from southeast England.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started coding when I took a home learning degree in Computing
                and IT and since then I haven't stopped. For the last 3 years
                since completing my degree I have been working as a developer
                for an insurance company where I maintain and build travel and
                home insurance websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started out as a front-end developer but over the last year I
                have moved into a developer role where I have taken on more of a
                fullstack position. The main tech stack at my current company is
                HTML, CSS, Javascript, C# and ASP.NET. However in my spare time
                I will code using React.js and Node.js and these would be my
                preferred tools if I was to build a website outside of my
                current job role.
            </p>
            <p>I aim to please by producing work to the highest quality.</p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working I can be found spending time with the
                family or working out in the gym. I am also an MMO lover but I
                don't get too much time for that these days.
